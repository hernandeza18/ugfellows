## Abdur Khan

My name is Abdur Khan and I’m a senior at Washington and Lee University. I’m from Perrysburg, Ohio but I was born in Pakistan. I’m a French major, on the premed track, but we’ll see how that goes. I’m working as a digital humanities fellow and at the ITS helpdesk this year, and I’m co-president of the QuestBridge scholars chapter here. I’m also involved in leadership positions in Alpha Phi Omega and WLUR. I have a twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn so hmu.
