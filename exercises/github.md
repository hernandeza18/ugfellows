# GitHub Exercises

After each exercise here, sync your computer with this repository. You'll need a partner for exercises 5 on.

1. Copy the contents of this website to your computer.

2. Make yourself a folder by your last name in the style of "walsh/".

3. Write yourself a bio and add it as a file in your folder. 

4. Add that same bio to the fellows.md file.

5. Find a partner who is also learning GitHub.

6. Assign each other an issue that reads "Have a conversation with X" where X is your partner's name. 

7. Have a conversation with your partner through GitHub. One of you should make a file called conversation.md in your own folder. By pushing and pulling to that folder, talk to each other one line at a time. Aim for five contributions each. When you're done, copy the file to the folder of whoever did not create it. Your conversation will look something like this

Brandon: HI MACKENZIE

Mackenzie: HI 

Brandon: WE ARE USING GITHUB 

Mackenzie: WHY ARE YOU SO SURPRISED 

etc.

8. Close your issues. (Can you figure out how to close an issue through command line?)
